# digitalFootprint

## Description
The QREPRS (Quick Response Encrypted Protection Recovery System) creates a means to recover a user’s digital footprint 
in a quick and secure manner. This allows digitalFootprint to never store any personal information
after the mapping process but allow user’s to recover their account should they have future questions 
or concerns. Essentially the user receives a QR code containing a mapping of their digital footprint. 
On submission to digitalFootprint, this QR can be used to rebuild the user’s mapping. 
*\*Each QREPRS will be encrypted and only digitalFootprint will be able to read the data stored.*\*
