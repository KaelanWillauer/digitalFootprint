## Description
The internetVulnerabilityCalculator attempts to estimate one’s overall internet exposure based on some basic information. 
It does so by using the rudimentary information as a base and combining it with anonymous statistics form other users’ data. 
Eventually the calculator should integrate into the project’s webpage. 
\**The internetVulnerabilityCalculator score should only be taken as a quick estimate and 
does not represent a true calculation of one’s score.*\*
